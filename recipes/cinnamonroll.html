    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>180ml milk</li>
        <li>2 tsp active dry yeast</li>
        <li>50 grams granulated sugar</li>
        <li>4 tbsp salted butter, melted & cooled</li>
        <li>1 large egg + 1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>360 grams bread flour</li>
        <li>pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><h4>Filling</h4></p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tbsp softened butter</li>
        <li>140 grams packed dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <p><h4>Cream Cheese Frosting</h4></p>
    <ul>
        <li>115 grams cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>85 grams powdered sugar</li>
        <li>3 tbsp salted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the dough: In a small microwave-safe bowl, 
            warm the milk by microwaving it for 45 seconds to 1 minute, 
            until it registers 115°F on a thermometer and feels like warm bath water.</li>
        <li>Place the warmed milk in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment 
            and sprinkle the yeast on top. (If using active dry yeast, add the sugar now 
            and let the yeast sit with the sugar until foamy, about 5 minutes.)</li>
        <li>Add the sugar, then the melted butter, egg, and egg yolk. 
            Mix on medium speed until well combined. 
            Remove the bowl from the mixer and use a wooden spoon 
            to stir in the flour and salt until a dough begins to form</li>
        <li>Mix the dough on medium speed until it comes together 
            and feels soft and slightly sticky, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Lightly grease a large bowl with olive oil. Transfer the dough ball to the bowl, 
            then cover with plastic wrap and the warm towel. 
            Allow the dough to rise until doubled in size, 1 to 1½ hours.</li>
        <li>Prepare the filling: In a small bowl, mix together the brown sugar and cinnamon. 
            Use your hands to sprinkle the mixture over the butter, 
            then gently rub the brown sugar mixture into the butter. </li>
        <li>Starting from the short side without the margin, very tightly roll up the dough.</li>
        <li>Using unflavored dental floss or a serrated knife, cut the dough into nine 1-inch slices.</li>
        <li>Place the rolls in the prepared baking pan. Cover with plastic wrap and a towel 
            and let rise again until the rolls have puffed up, are doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F, then bake 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Prepare the cream cheese frosting: In the bowl of a stand mixer 
            fitted with the whisk attachment, combine the cream cheese, powdered sugar, butter, and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Spread the frosting over the warm rolls and serve.</li>
    </ol>
