    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>200g butter</li>
        <li>200g dark chocolate chips</li>
        <li>175g brown sugar</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>75g plain flour</li>
        <li>30g cocoa powder</li>
        <li>pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the ofen to 180Â°C</li>
        <li>Spray a 20cm square tin with oil and line with baking paper</li>
        <li>Place butter and chocolate chips in a heatproof bowl, 
            microwave in 30 second bursts (takes me 1m 30 sec) until melted. 
            Stir until smooth.</li>
        <li>Add sugar and vanilla, mix, then add eggs 
            and mix well until smooth and molten.</li>
        <li>Add flour, cocoa and salt and stir until smooth. 
            Stir in chopped chocolate, pour into pan.</li>
        <li>Bake 24 minutes for really gooey in the centre, 
            28 minutes for fudgey but still very moist, 
            32 minutes for moist fudge-cake-like.</li>
        <li>If you didn't use the extra chocolate for stirring in, 
            reduce cook time by 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rest for 10 minutes before lifting out of the pan. 
            Allow to cool for at least 20 minutes before cutting. 
            Store in an airtight container for 4 days (bet they don't 
            last that long!) or freeze for 3 months.</li>
    </ol>
